# Biography
Hi, I'm Cami! I'm a 22y/o individual who's adjusting to life after college and enjoying every minute of it. I love cooking, taking photos, and hanging out with my friends. On a good day, you'll probably find me sitting in a cafe with my laptop and a cup of milk tea.

# Skills
I recently graduated from one of the top universities in the Philippines as a distinguished student leader with high academic honors. From a young age, I have been exposed to business operations and management strategies used in my family's business, giving me a strong background in business administrative processes. I am a highly competitive individual with a keen eye for detail who loves taking on challenges alongside other people.

As a developer, I have experience working with various frameworks and platforms (i.e., Mobile Apps, Web Apps, Systems). I have designed and implemented the front-end of several applications, as well as worked on the back-end of platforms by drafting databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, MongoDB) and using frameworks such as PHP CodeIgniter (with RESTful), Ruby on Rails, and C# ASP.NET. Additionally, I have a specialization in data science and analytics, and have used platforms like RapidMiner and SAP for mining data, creating models, and deploying outputs.

I'm primarily interested in organizational development and setting quality standards for business and software development through data-driven strategies. My specialties include software engineering, operations management, process streamlining, and data analysis.
