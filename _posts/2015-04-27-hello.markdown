Hi, I'm Cami! This is the first pass of my attempt at making a personal blog. I've yet to learn how to work around the Octopress/Jekyll framework without looking up references often, but I'm certain I'll find my way around them in due time. 

In addition to learning how to deploy a project with `git`, I'm also hoping to improve my writing skills and programming practices as I contribute to this blog. 

I hope you enjoy your stay here!
