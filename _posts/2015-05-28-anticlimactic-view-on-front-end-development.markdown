I'm writing this post today as I find myself, more often than not, debating on whether to concentrate on learning back-end or front-end development in preparation for my career. Here are my somewhat composed thoughts on the matter.

I've always thought I'd end up developing a company's logic back-end, as I'd decided when I was 13 that I was absolutely done with web development, and did not want anything to do with it. However, after spending a few weeks making layouts, being inspired by several web apps and noticing how 75% of my Github repositories are in CSS, I started rethinking my decision.

I'll admit that I love UI/UX design, and take pleasure in tweaking every margin, padding and media query down to the last pixel. Lately, I've also been interested in developing web applications, and have a few ideas I'm hoping to implement by the end of summer this year. I even have tabs on [Go](http://golang.org) tutorials as I'm writing this post, which I'm aiming to learn and use to develop the aforementioned apps.

It's ironic, though - I cannot, for the life of me, program with Javascript or PHP. I probably should take more initiative to learn those languages, but something about their language structures and having to constanty use `$` just throws me off. Of course, given the rising popularity of nodeJS, AngularJS and every other framework an average web developer is **expected** to know nowadays, I'm immediately forced to shut down my option of going down the front-end career path.

I honestly do not mind back-end development at all, so closing off front-end as a main career path isn't much of a bad thing for me. For one, I feel that I'm better inclined to adapting to back-end technologies than those of front-end, and would therefore perform better and be happier as a back-end developer. I also like the idea of listing front-end development as a side hobby without the pressure of having to be a full stack developer of sorts.

A good ending to this post would be a conclusive declaration of sorts, but I'm afraid I don't really have any of that at this point in time. Thanks for reading, anyway.
